### Application Structure

* This application consists of a front-end web page, an express server with RESTful routing and a mongo DB for data persistence (hosted by [mlab.com](mlab.com))
* The front end consists largely of jQuery event listeners that make appropriate AJAX calls to the server
* The RESTful API consists of the following routes
    * Users - Used for user sign up, sign in and validation: Routes - POST/validate, POST/signup, POST/signin, and DELETE/
    * Portfolios - Used for holding and dealing with users portfolios: Routes - GET/all, GET/leaderboard, GET/, PUT/buy, and PUT/sell
    * Stockstores - Used to hold an object containing each unique stock as key value pair for making our Yahoo API call: Routes - GET/, GET/:id, and POST/
    * YahooAPI - Used for interfacing with the YahooAPI to return data to the front end and to update all portfolios: Routes - GET/dailyUpdate and GET/
* All delete routes require admin level authentication
* Portfolio routes require user authentication prior to access
